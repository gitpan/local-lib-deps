NAME
    local::lib::deps - Maintain a module specific lib path for that modules
    dependencies.

DESCRIPTION
    Maintaining perl module dependencies through a distributions package
    manager can be a real pain. This module helps by making it easier to
    simply bundle all your applications dependencies into one lib path
    specific to the module. It also makes it easy to tell your applicatin
    where to look for modules.

SYNOPSYS
    Bootstrap your modules dependency area:

    TODO

    This will create a directory specifically for the My::Module namespace
    and install the specified dependencies (and local::lib) there.

    To use those deps in your app:

        use local::lib::deps qw/ My::Module /;
        use Dep::One;

    To initiate local::lib with the destination directory of your module:

    TODO

USE CASES
PUBLIC METHODS
    new( module => 'My::Module', base_path => 'path/to/module/libs' )
        Create a new local::lib::deps object.

    locallib( $module )
        Will get local::lib setup against the local::lib::deps dir. If
        called as a class method $module is manditory, if called as an
        object method $module is ignored.

    install_deps( $module, @deps )
        This will bootstrap local::lib into a local::lib::deps folder for
        the specified module, it will then continue to install (or update)
        all the dependency modules.

ACCESSOR METHODS
    module()
    base_path()
        Returns the base path that contains the module dependancy areas.
        This is documented because you may wish to override this in an
        application specific subclass.
